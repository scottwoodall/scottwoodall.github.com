Title: Create Spies With Your Gmail Address

Gmail has a feature that allows you to append a plus ("+") sign and any combination of characters after it. When I give out my email address, I'll add something unique like "+spiesblogpost" and end up with "scott.woodall+spiesblogpost@gmail.com".

The purpose of this is two-fold:

1. You can  create Gmail filters on the dynamic address.
2. If the unique address is ever shared, I'll know who distributed it.
