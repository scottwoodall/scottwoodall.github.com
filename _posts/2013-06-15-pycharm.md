Vim has always been my editor of choice but approximately every six months I'll get and itch to try something new. After reading [Andrew Brookins excellent review](http://andrewbrookins.com/tech/one-year-later-an-epic-review-of-pycharm-2-7-from-a-vim-users-perspective/) of PyCharm, it was time to scratch that itch.

These are my notes on issues I ran into while trying to configure PyCharm. So far I'm seeing a lot of potential, but getting everything configured how I want has been a huge time sink. There are small inconsistencies within the PyCharm documenation so things don't work as described. This leads to several hours wasted fixing things and has lead to frustration.

#### Vagrant Integration
* A `Vagrantfile` is automatically created for you after downloading a vagrant box. It has an incorrect `config.vm.box` value and should be changed to `lucid32`.
* When adding a Python remote interpreter, the `Private key file` has double quotes around the file name and need to be removed

####  IdeaVim
* You cannot remap keys, at least not yet according to the [GitHub repo[(https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim). My traditional Vi setup I'm able to remap things like `kj` to escape from insert mode.
